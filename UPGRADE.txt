Upgrading SimpleID
==================

Upgrading to SimpleID 0.6
-------------------------

SimpleID version 0.6 introduced a new log in system.  The new system allows
you to log in to SimpleID without sending your password in plain text.  Your
password is used to create a cryptographic digest, which is then sent to
the SimpleID server and verified.

As a result, you need to be aware of two things:

1.  You browser must have JavaScript switched on in order to use the new
    log in system.  If JavaScript is not switched on, SimpleID reverts to the
    "legacy" log in system used in previous versions, subject to the important
    point below.
    
2.  By default, SimpleID version 0.6 will not accept logins under the legacy
    system.  You can override this by putting the following line in your
    config.inc:
    
    define('SIMPLEID_ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN', true);
    
    It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you DO NOT switch the legacy login system
    on, as it is substantially less secure than the new login system.  Use this
    ONLY if your browser does not support JavaScript.
